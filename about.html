The department offers BE and M.Tech degrees in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) with an intake 120 UG students and 24 PG students respectively. The department has a VTU recognized R&D centre and currently 18 research scholars are pursuing their research work leading to PhD/MSc (Engg) degrees. The department has state-of-the-art laboratories, library facility for staff &students and boasts of well trained, committed and experienced teaching faculty with an average teaching experience of 10.04 years, who emphasize the theoretical and practical applications of computation and computer systems to the needs of society.

The department is striving hard to make the unique spirit of RNSIT, an Institution with a difference by promoting excellence in Teaching, Research and Services covering the fundamentals as well as applied aspects of Computer Science and IT.

The fast changing scenario in Computer Science and Engineering necessitates the department to actively extend its focus and activities in

Research and Development
Consultancy in IT related areas and Sponsored projects apart from its excellent conventional UG and PG teaching.
Being a forerunner in the field of technology, the department envisages evolving as a center of excellence to adapt itself to the rapid advancements in various specialized fields. Computer Science and Engineering continues to be the driving force of the nation's economy in the fields of science and technology.
